Player and CPU take turns deciding between flipping a card or keeping their hand, starting with the player. 
Four cards are dealt to each side at the start of every game from a deck of only one suit, meaning there are no duplicated values.
To flip a card and add it to your hand, simply tap on a face down card.
To keep your hand, tap the card at the center of the screen. Doing so will clear your side of all face down cards and you will not be able to add them to your hand on consequent turns.
Classic rules of Blackjack apply. 
Highest score up to 21 wins.
Player loses in case of a tie.
Ace is worth 11 until the score exceeds 21 and is then worth 1 instead.
